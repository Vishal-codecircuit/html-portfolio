<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> My name is Vishal. I like to build small scale softwares which saves time and and increase
  the ease of use in a product
</p>

<p> Currently learning web development after that i will be making two custom projects.
  I plan to complete both of them in a span of 2 months
</p>

<p> 
  This month i.e. August , I will be completing my web development boot camp and the next month
  i will start building both of my custom projects. The first project is building a custom music loop
  in real time and the second project is to create a ordering software for a cafe which can be 
  customized by the cafe owners.
